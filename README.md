# Does model compression reverse LLM unlearning?

A short empirical study testing whether routine post-training compression
(quantization, magnitude pruning, SVD truncation) causes "unlearned" knowledge
to reappear in open-weight LLMs.

Built for the BlueDot Technical AI Safety Project Sprint.

## Motivation

Open-weight models can't rely on deployment-time safeguards (refusal filters,
usage monitoring) — once weights are public, those are trivially removed. That
makes weight-level interventions like *unlearning* one of the few tools that
could actually remove dangerous knowledge rather than just suppress its
expression. But unlearning is only useful if it survives normal handling. Models
are routinely compressed before deployment, and there is preliminary evidence
that quantization can partially reverse some unlearning methods. This project
measures, across methods and compression types, whether standard (non-adversarial)
compression restores forgotten knowledge.

## Setup

- **Benchmark:** [OpenUnlearning](https://github.com/locuslab/open-unlearning)
  TOFU, `forget10` split, `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct`.
- **Lead metric:** `forget_Q_A_Prob` (probability the model produces the correct
  answer to forget-set questions). Secondary: `forget_Q_A_ROUGE`,
  `extraction_strength`. Control: `model_utility`.
- **Reference anchors:**
  - Ceiling (full knowledge): `open-unlearning/tofu_Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct_full`
    (official `forget_Q_A_Prob` ≈ 0.88)
  - Floor (genuine ignorance): `open-unlearning/tofu_Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct_retain90`
    (official `forget_Q_A_Prob` ≈ 0.12)

## Test subjects

Three unlearning methods spanning two forgetting mechanisms, selected by
qualitative screening (retain only those that removed target knowledge while
staying fluent):

| Method | Mechanism | Checkpoint |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| NPO    | fabrication | `unlearn_tofu_Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct_forget10_NPO_lr1e-05_beta0.1_alpha1_epoch10` |
| SimNPO | fabrication | `unlearn_tofu_Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct_forget10_SimNPO_lr5e-05_b4.5_a1_d1_g0.25_ep10` |
| IdkDPO | refusal | `unlearn_tofu_Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct_forget10_IdkDPO_lr5e-05_beta0.05_alpha5_epoch10` |

Excluded after screening: **GradDiff** (under-forgot) and **RMU** (either failed
to forget or collapsed into incoherent generation at this model scale).

## Compression sweep

Each test subject × { 4-bit quant, 8-bit quant, magnitude pruning @ several
sparsities, SVD truncation @ several ranks }, measuring `forget_Q_A_Prob` (+
secondary + control metrics) per cell. Recovery = drift from the floor toward the
ceiling **without** proportional `model_utility` damage.

## Status

- [x] Reference floor/ceiling validated (qualitative + official summary metrics)
- [x] Test subjects screened and locked
- [x] Harness reproduces `forget_Q_A_Prob` ≈ 0.88 on `_full` (correctness gate)
- [x] Pre-compression baselines for the three test subjects
- [x] Compression sweep
- [x] Results matrix + write-up

## Results

### Reference anchors

| Model | `forget_Q_A_Prob` | `forget_Q_A_ROUGE` | `extraction_strength` | `model_utility` |
|-------|------------------:|-------------------:|----------------------:|----------------:|
| Ceiling (`_full`) | 0.881 | 0.820 | 0.706 | 0.599 |
| Floor (`_retain90`) | 0.116 | 0.379 | 0.059 | 0.591 |

### Pre-compression baselines

| Method | `forget_Q_A_Prob` | `forget_Q_A_ROUGE` | `extraction_strength` | `model_utility` |
|--------|------------------:|-------------------:|----------------------:|----------------:|
| NPO    | 0.209 | 0.186 | 0.097 | 0.430 |
| SimNPO | 0.075 | 0.343 | 0.064 | 0.583 |
| IdkDPO | 0.017 | 0.145 | 0.047 | 0.567 |

All three methods are near or below the floor (0.116), confirming effective unlearning before compression. NPO sits slightly above the floor; SimNPO and IdkDPO are below it.

### Compression sweep (`forget_Q_A_Prob`)

`--` = model utility collapsed (≤ 0.01), cell not interpretable as recovery.

| Compression | level | NPO | SimNPO | IdkDPO |
|-------------|-------|----:|-------:|-------:|
| baseline | — | 0.209 | 0.075 | 0.017 |
| 8-bit quant | — | 0.209 | 0.078 | 0.017 |
| 4-bit quant | — | **0.353** | 0.085 | 0.023 |
| prune | 10% | **0.352** | 0.079 | 0.019 |
| prune | 30% | 0.207 | 0.103 | 0.037 |
| prune | 50% | -- | -- | -- |
| prune | 70% | -- | -- | -- |
| SVD | keep 25% | -- | -- | -- |
| SVD | keep 50% | -- | -- | -- |
| SVD | keep 75% | -- | -- | -- |
| SVD | keep 90% | -- | -- | -- |

### Normalized recovery (% of ceiling–baseline range recovered)

Recovery is defined as `(compressed − baseline) / (ceiling − baseline)`, where
ceiling = 0.881 and baseline is per-method. Destructive cells (model utility ≤ 0.01) omitted.

| Compression | NPO | SimNPO | IdkDPO |
|-------------|----:|-------:|-------:|
| 8-bit quant |  0% |     0% |     0% |
| 4-bit quant | **22%** |  1% |  1% |
| prune 10%   | **21%** |  1% |  0% |
| prune 30%   |  0% |     3% |  2% |

### Findings

**NPO is meaningfully vulnerable to 4-bit quantization and light pruning.**
Both conditions push `forget_Q_A_Prob` from 0.21 to ~0.35, recovering 21–22%
of the ceiling–baseline range without a proportional drop in `model_utility`
(0.44 vs 0.43 baseline). This is the only signal in the sweep that represents
unambiguous compression-driven knowledge recovery.

**SimNPO and IdkDPO are robust within non-destructive compression ranges.**
Across all non-destructive cells, both methods recover at most 3% of their
respective ceiling–baseline ranges. IdkDPO (refusal mechanism) is particularly
stable: `forget_Q_A_Prob` stays at or below 0.037 everywhere.

**SVD truncation and heavy pruning (≥ 50%) destroy model utility across the board.**
`model_utility` collapses to near zero in all these cells, so any change in
`forget_Q_A_Prob` reflects model failure rather than knowledge recovery.
These compression levels are not practically relevant.

**ROUGE and Prob dissociate for NPO at 30% pruning.**
At prune-30%, NPO's `forget_Q_A_Prob` is flat (0.207 ≈ baseline 0.209), yet
`forget_Q_A_ROUGE` nearly doubles (0.361 vs 0.186 baseline). The model generates
text more surface-similar to ground-truth answers without the token probability
of the exact answer recovering — suggesting partial lexical recovery that the
lead metric misses, and that the two metrics capture different aspects of forgetting.

**The mechanism appears to matter more than the compression type.**
NPO and SimNPO both use a fabrication mechanism (outputting wrong details), yet
they differ sharply in vulnerability. This likely reflects NPO's weaker unlearning
baseline (0.21 vs 0.075 for SimNPO) rather than a mechanistic difference — NPO
was always further from the floor, so there was more distance to recover.

**No compression type restores knowledge to the ceiling.**
Even in the strongest recovery case (NPO + 4-bit quant, 22% recovery), the model
remains far below the full-knowledge ceiling. Standard compression does not
constitute a practical attack on these unlearning methods.

## Reproducing

All scripts assume the [OpenUnlearning](https://github.com/locuslab/open-unlearning)
harness is cloned to `/workspace/open-unlearning`. Set `HF_HOME` to your model
cache. See `setup.sh` for environment setup, `run_sweep.sh` for the compression
sweep, and `collect_sweep.py` to aggregate results.
